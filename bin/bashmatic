# This is a simple helper that serves three functions:
#   1. If BASHMATIC_HOME is not set, it tries very hard to figure it out
#   2. If Bashmatic is not installed, it attempts to install it.
#   3. If an argument is a Bashmatic function, it executes it.
#
# This script is particularly useful when your defualt shell is not BASH.
# It allows you to still invoke most of Bashmatic's helpers using:
#
#   $ bashmatic <helper> <args> 
#
# syntax.

# shellcheck disable=2046
