# SCENE II. The Mart.

## Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse, DROMIO of Syracuse, and First Merchant

### First Merchant

herefore give out you are of Epidamnum,
Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
This very day a Syracusian merchant
Is apprehended for arrival here;
And not being able to buy out his life
According to the statute of the town,
Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
There is your money that I had to keep. 

ANTIPHOLUS

#### OF SYRACUSE

Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
Within this hour it will be dinner-time:
Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
And then return and sleep within mine inn,
For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
Get thee away.

#### DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Many a man would take you at your word,
And go indeed, having so good a mean.
Exit

ANTIPHOLUS
