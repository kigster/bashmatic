# Graphite CLI Changelog

## 0.20.11 2022-09-26
- Changed many error messages to be more actionable, and changed some tips to always-visible messages.
- Improved accuracy of checking whether a branch is up to date on `submit`.
- The `--edit/-e` flag on `submit` now opens an editor for each PR without prompting first.  Passing no flag still prompts the user whether they'd like to open an editor, and `--no-edit` still skips the prompt,
- The `--select/-s` flag of `submit` now prompts about which branches to include in the submit as the first step so that it can validate that the correct dependencies are included in the submit scope.
- Fixed a bug preventing creation of a debug context within a large repository.
- Fixed a bug logging output for `gt branch test` on branches with a slash in the name.
- Running git commands no longer opens another terminal on Windows.


## 0.20.10 2022-08-02

- Addressed one remaining gap in pager parity with git: set the environment variables `LESS=FRX` and `LV=-c` if unset.

## 0.20.9 2022-08-02

- Fixed remaining issues with pager by switching from a temp file to a pipe.
- Fixed a bug where `gt log short` wouldn't show the filled-in circle for branches needing a restack.
- Fixed a bug where `gt branch split` untracked children of the branch being split if the last branch in the split kept its name.

## 0.20.8 2022-07-29

- Improved error mesaging around failed pager execution.

## 0.20.7 2022-07-29

- `gt log`, `gt changelog`, and `gt branch info` now display in a pager.  The pager defaults to your git pager, but can be overridden with (for example) `gt user pager --set 'less -FRX'`.

- Fixed a bug where `--no-edit` on `submit` would automatically open new PRs in draft mode (it now prompts unless `--draft`, `--publish`, or `--no-interactive` is set).
- Fixed a bug where killing the CLI during submit could result in being unable to submit again (due to a temporary filename clash).
- Fixed colors for `gt branch info --patch`.
- Fixed a bug related to buffer size for certain git commands.
- Fixed the error displayed when attempting to install Graphite on old Node.js versions.

## 0.20.6 2022-07-25

- `submit` after an aborted submit now asks the user whether they'd like to use their cached PR body instead of always using it.
- `gt branch split` now tracks untracked branches automatically before splitting.
- `gt branch untrack` now untracks the current branch if no branch name is provided.
- Fixed an issue where `gt branch create` would fail instead of creating a branch with no commit in certain cases.
- Fixed `gt branch edit`.

## 0.20.5 2022-07-22

- Fixed `gt changelog`.
- Fixed `submit`, `downstack edit` for editor commands containing spaces.
- Fixed `git push` errors being swallowed on submit.

## 0.20.4 2022-07-21

- Added `gt changelog` and `gt docs`.  You probably want to pipe the changelog to a pager or file :).
- Fixed a bug where a `git rebase --abort` after a restack conflict would result in Graphite being wrong about the current branch.
- Improved `test` command output.
- Internal improvements.

## 0.20.3 2022-07-21

- Minor internal fix.

## 0.20.2 2022-07-19

- Fixed an issue preventing installation.

## 0.20.1 2022-07-19

- Fixed an issue preventing installation.

## 0.20.0 2022-07-19

- Added a new command `gt branch split` that allows the user to interactive split a branch into multiple dependent branches. There are two styles of operation:

  - `--by-commit` mode (aliases `--commit`, `-c`) prompts the user to select the commits within the branch that they'd like to have branches at.
  - `--by-hunk` mode (aliases `--hunk`, `-h`) prompts the user to create a series of single-commit branches from the changes of the branch using the `git add --patch` interface.

- Greatly improved `gt log short` readability. Give it a try!

- `gt branch create`, `gt commit create`, and `gt commit amend` now support the `-p/--patch` option (like `git commit --patch`). Please note that this won't be the most useful option until autostashing is implemented, planned soon.

- Branch navigation commands now notify the user if the branch being checked out is either
  - behind its parent (needs restacking)
  - upstack of a branch that is behind its parent
  - untracked
- `gt log` and `gt log short` now show untracked branches when `--show-untracked/-u` is passed in.
- `gt branch checkout` now includes untracked branches in the selector when `--show-untracked/-u` is passed in.

- Added `-n` as an alias for `--no-edit` for `submit`. Try out `gt ss -np` to quickly publish your changes!
- Added `--select`/`-s` option for `submit` to select which branches to push.
- Added `--force`/`-f` option `submit` to do a force-push, i.e. `git push -f`, instead of the default `git push --force-with-lease`.
- Added a non-blocking note if the user submits a branch that is not restacked on trunk.
- On trying to submit branches with PRs already closed/merged, instead of failing immediately users will be prompted to choose either to abort or create new PRs.
- `submit` now correctly sets the upstream of the pushed branch.
- You can now configure whether you'd like commit messages in PR bodies by default behind the configuration `gt user submit-body --include-commit-messages`. Disabled by default. Use `gt user submit-body --no-include-commit-messages` to disable.

- Added `--force`/`-f` for `gt downstack get` to always overwrite local branches.
- `gt downstack track` can now take a positional branch name argument (like `gt branch track`).

- Added `--diff`/`-d` for `gt branch info` to show the diff of the whole branch (unlike `--patch`/`-p` which shows the diff of each commit).

- Interactive prompts autocomplete is now case-insensitive.
- `gt --help` now includes a link to the CLI documention.

- Improved `gt repo init` copy.
- Improved error messaging for when an internal `git` command fails.
- Improved error messaging for when a `submit` command fails due to a GitHub API error.
- Improved `test` command output.
- Improved clarity of positional arguments for all commands with them in `--help`
- Improved performance of internal cache.
- Improved telemetry.

- Fixed a bug where `test` commands were completely broken.
- Fixed a bug where `upstack onto` autocomplete did not work if `uso` shortcut was used.
- Fixed a bug where `--no-interactive` and `--no-edit` were not handled properly for `submit`
- Fixed a bug where `gt log` would break on the initial commit of a repository.
- Fixed a bug where trunk would be in the list of branches to track in `gt repo init`
- Fixed a bug where the error message for old versions of Node.js wouldn't show up.
- Added cycle detection for parent pointers.

## 0.19.6 2022-07-07

- Fixed a bug where continue state could be corrupted by running a `gt` command before running `gt continue`.
- Fixed a bug where `upstack onto` could target untracked branches, resulting in corrupted state.
- Fixed a bug where renaming a branch to its current name resulted in corrupted state.
- Added `dstr` as an alias for `downstack track`.
- Slightly improved rebase conflict printout.

## 0.19.5 2022-07-06

- Added a new command `gt downstack track` that, from an untracked branch, allows you to track recursively by choosing the parent until you reach a tracked branch. Use `--force/-f` to automatically select the nearest ancestor of each branch, which should give behavior similar to `gt stack fix --regen` of old.
- Added a new command `gt branch fold` that folds the changes of the current branch into the parent branch. Uses the parent branch's name for the new branch with default; pass in `--keep/-k` to use the current branch's name instead.
- Added a new command `gt branch squash` that turns a branch of multiple commits into a single-commit branch. Takes `--message/-m` and `--no-edit/-n` arguments just like `gt commit amend`, and defaults to using the message of the first commit on the branch.

- Fixed a bug where if neither `--draft` nor `--submit` was passed, updated PRs would always be published if previously drafts, and new PRs would be published instead of being created as draft.
- Fixed a bug where `gt branch track --force` wouldn't always select the nearest ancestor.
- Fixed a bug where `gt` with no command would throw an uncaught exception instead of displaying the help message.
- Fixed a bug where cancelling certain interactive prompts would result in undefined behavior.

## 0.19.4 2022-07-05

- Based on a user survey, we've slightly changed the defaults for PR title and description on `submit` commands.
  - PR Title defaults to the title of the first (or only) commit on the branch.
  - PR Description defaults to a list of commit messages followed by a PR template, if one exists.
- `branch info` and `log` now show the commit hash of trunk.
- Added a `repo init --reset` which clears all Graphite metadata.
- Added a new user-scoped configuration enabled by `gt user restack-date --use-author-date` which when enabled passes `--committer-date-is-author-date` to the internal `git rebase` of restack operations. To return to the default, use `gt user restack-date --no-use-author-date`.
- Added autocompletion for the `branch up` disambiguation prompt.
- Added `gt dpr` as a shortcut for `gt dash pr`
- Renamed the `--no-draft` option for `submit` commands to `--publish/-p`. There are three modes of operation for the command:
  - By default, leave existing PRs in the same state and create new PRs in draft mode.
  - When `--draft/-d` is passed, all PRs in the submit scope will be marked as draft.
  - When `--publish/-p` is passed, all PRs in the submit scope will be marked ready for review.
- Added an interactive prompt for `gt branch rename` when no new name is passed in.
- Added a `--force/-f` option for `gt branch track` that skips the interactive prompt by picking the nearest tracked ancestor.

- Fixed a bug where `branch submit` and `downstack submit` base validation would fail incorrectly on certain operating systems.
- Fixed a bug where leftover cached metadata across CLI versions could result in inconsistent state.

## 0.19.3 2022-06-28

- Changed the flow of `gt branch track`. Now, it tracks the current branch by default, unless another branch is specified. By default, prompts the user to select a branch to be its parent if there are multiple possibilities, or you can pass in a `--parent`.
- Updated the new `log short` view to be more comprehensible (uses diagram symbols from `log`).

- Fixed a bug where `--restack` wouldn't restack all branches as expected if `gt repo sync` was run from trunk.
- Fixed a bug where `gt ss` would fail if run from trunk.
- Fixed a bug where `gt downstack get` would fail to get branches that existed locally but were untracked by `gt`.
- Fixed a bug where after a `git rebase`, Graphite metadata could end up in a broken state.
- Fixed a bug that prevented `gt feedback --with-debug-context` from working as expected.
- Fixed a bug where `gt upstack onto` interactive selection could appear wonky.

- Fixed some copy in v0.19 newly added features.

## 0.19.2 2022-06-15

- Fixed an issue where `downstack get` was completely broken.
- Replaced the emoji for `Pushing to remote and creating/updating PRs...` step of `submit`
- Fixed an issue where `gt branch edit` would only work if the branch was not in need of restacking.
- Added support to rebase local changes on top of remote for `downstack get`
- Fixed a bug where choosing to cancel `submit` because of an empty branch did not abort correctly.

## 0.19.1 2022-06-14

- Removed some development tooling as a workaround to unblock Homebrew release. Sorry for the delay!
- Fixed a shebang issue that resulted from trying to clean up Node.js v18 warnings. Added a different fix to prevent Node.js warnings from showing up in CLI output.
- Fixed a bug with Node.js v14 support.
- Changed the Homebrew Node.js dependency to v16, which is the same as we use for development.

## 0.19.0 2022-06-13

- Ensured every commonly used command has an alias and changed a few names. A current list of commands will be included in the Community Slack with this release.

  - `gt branch show` is now `gt branch info`. As this command is relatively new, we are not leaving `show` as an alias.
  - `gt branch create --restack` is now `gt branch create --insert`. This was the originally intended name, and it does something different than `gt repo sync --restack`
  - `gt downstack sync` is now `gt downstack get`. It was confusing to have two `sync` commands do entirely different things!
  - The old names `gt branch prev` and `gt branch next` for `down` and `up` are now fully deprecated.

- Updated a significant portion of the info and error messages spanning almost every command.
- Ensured every command has up-to-date and helpful `--help`.
- Added a number of tips to various commands.
- Greatly improved autcompletion — now every command has autocomplete for nouns, verbs, flags, and branch names when applicable.
- `gt branch checkout`, `gt upstack onto`, and `gt branch track` now all have substring autocompletion for interactive branch selection. Enjoy! :D
- `gt auth` and `gt user` commands can now be run outside of a Git repository.

- Removed the concept of "ignored branches" from `gt repo init`, and the user config.Removed the `gt repo ignored-branches` command.
- Removed `gt <scope> fix`. `fix` is now an alias for `restack`.
- Removed `gt <scope> validate`
- Removed `gt branch parent`, `gt branch children`, and `gt branch pr-info`. All of this information is now found in `gt branch info`. `gt branch rename` is now the only way to reset PR info for a branch, as PR info is now synced by branch name for the open PR with that name.
- Removed `gt repo fix`.
- Removed `gt repo trunk`. You can change the trunk branch by running `gt repo init --trunk <trunkName>` .
- Removed `exec` functionality of `gt downstack edit` — we recommend using `gt stack test` for running a command on each branch in your stack.

- Added a new command `gt branch track`. In order to track an existing git branch `<branchName>`, ensure that it is based on a Graphite branch `<parentBranchName>`, and then with `<parentBranchName>` checked out, run `gt branch track <branchName>` to start tracking it as a Graphite branch.
  - You can also specify a `--parent` in `gt branch track` instead of checking out the desired parent before running the command.
  - If run without a branch to track `gt branch track` suggests branches that have the current branch/specified parent in their history.
- Added `gt branch untrack` to remove Graphite metadata for a branch.
- Added a new flow to `gt repo init` for letting users new to Graphite convert an existing "stack" of branches into a Graphite stack. Essentially calls `gt branch track` in a loop.

- Added a new verb `gt <scope> restack` for the `branch`, `upstack`, `downstack`, and `stack` nouns. For each branch in the scope, this command checks if the branch is based on its parent, and rebases it if necessary. `gt upstack fix` and `gt stack fix` will alias to `restack` for a couple versions.

- Improved `gt log short` - the view now essentially a single-line-per-branch version of `gt log`. The old style can still be accessed with `gt log short --classic`.
- Added a `--reverse` option to `gt log` and `gt log short`. Helpful for big stacks!
- Added `--stack` option for `gt log` and `gt log short`. Only displays the current stack (i.e. what `gt stack submit` would submit).
- Added `--steps <n>` option for `gt log` and `gt log short`. Implies `--stack` and only shows `n` levels above and below the current branch.
- Rebase conflict message now shows a `gt log short --steps 3` centered at the branch being resolved.
- Interactive selection for `gt branch checkout` and `gt upstack onto` now uses the new `gt log short` view. Much easier to see what you're doing with long branch names!

- `gt dash` can now open the PR page for the current branch or a specified one: `gt dash pr [numberOrBranchName]`
- `gt branch info` can now show the current PR description with `--description`.
- Added `upstack` and `downstack` counterparts of `gt branch test`.

- `gt branch delete` now restacks the deleted branch's children onto its parent.

- Removed the `--resubmit` flow from `repo sync` — we may add it back in the future.
- Added a `--restack` option to `repo sync`, which restacks the current branch and any branches in stacks with cleaned up branches. We imagine a common flow if you know that you don't have conflicts with trunk will be `gt rs -rf`. Or even `gt rs -rf && gt ss`.

- Fixed a bug where `--draft` and `--no-draft` on `submit` commands would unnecessarily submit unchanged PRs.
- Fixed bugs related to rebases not being performed properly that often resulted in confusing state and messaging.

- Now fails gracefully if running on an unsupported Node.js version (requires Node.js version 14 or higher)
- The Graphite CLI experience survey is no longer shown when commands are run in non-interactive mode.

**Note from the maintainers:**

Thanks for trying out the new version of the Graphite CLI! Please let us know if you see any issues with this new version, or have any suggestions for improvements related to functionality, flow, or transparency/simplicity.

New documentation for the CLI is coming soon! We love hearing your feedback about what documentation would be helpful — keep it coming!

Rebasing on `gt downstack get` has been outscoped for this release in order to get it to you sooner! We're still excited to put it out soon.

## 0.18.7 2022-05-31

- Fixed a pervasive bug that prevented using `gt` on Windows at all — there are likely still remaining issues to work out before we have full support, and we still recommend using WSL for the most stable Graphite experience. Thanks to our community for helping out here!
- Fixed a bug where `git push` error messages would not be displayed on `submit`, resulting in confusion around whether pushes were failing because of e.g. `pre-push` hooks or`--force-with-lease` errors.
- Added better support for multiple checkouts (i.e. `git worktree`). We consider our support experimental, see the new section of the docs for details.

## 0.18.6 2022-05-20

- Fixed a bug where running `gt branch rename` on submitted branches would result in `gt` becoming largely unusable.
- Added a new `--force/-f` option to `gt branch rename` that is required for already-submitted branches.
- `gt branch rename` now respects character replacement settings.

## 0.18.5 2022-05-19

- `.` and `/` are no longer replaced in branch names.
- Fixed a regression where the current branch wouldn't be selected by default in `gt branch checkout` interactive mode.
- Upgraded `node` and `yarn` dependencies, please let us know if you see any weirdness!

## 0.18.4 2022-05-16

- `gt downstack sync` no longer requires turning on a configuration option to use (for real this time)

## 0.18.3 2022-05-13

- Rewrote `gt downstack sync` using a different mechanism for fetching remote stack dependencies.
- `gt downstack sync` no longer requires turning on a configuration option to use.
- Fixed an issue in `submit` where in-progress PR title wouldn't be saved if the user cancelled while writing the body.

## 0.18.2 2022-05-12

- Fixed certain cases of an issue where restacking after `stack edit` and `commit create` would use an incorrect upstream. A broader fix is coming in v0.19.0.
- Fixed an issue where after certain `downstack edit` or `upstack onto` flows, branches would be pushed to GitHub in an order that caused them to be closed prematurely.
- Added `gt branch-prefix --reset` to turn off the user prefix for automatically generated branch names.
- Cleaned up copy in `submit` commands.

## 0.18.1 2022-05-10

- `gt repo sync` and `gt repo fix` now prompt to delete closed branches in addition to merged ones.
- Added more customization for auto-generated branch name prefixes. Check out `gt user branch-date` and `gt user branch-replacement`.
- Config files are now written with 600 permissions instead of 644.
- Fixed an issue where `downstack sync` would overwrite the local copy of a branch even if the user chose not to.
- Fixed an issue where a misconfigured trunk wouldn't be brought to the user's attention.
- Fixed an issue where Graphite would fail to parse repository owner/name.
- Removed deprecation warning for `gt stacks` - it's been long enough.
- Cleaned up interactive mode copy for `submit`.

## 0.18.0 2022-05-04

**New functionality**

- Added an experimental command `gt downstack sync` to pull down the remote copy of a branch and its downstack dependencies from remote. This feature is gated behind a configuration by default, and we are still working on the documentation. If you would like to try it out and help us iterate on the feature, please join the #experimental channel in the Graphite community Slack server!
- Added additional functionality to `submit` to support the experimental collaboration features. Gated by default.
- Added additional functionality to `gt repo sync` to support the experimental collaboration features. Gated by default.

**New commands**

- Added a new command `gt branch edit` that runs a native `git rebase --interactive` over the commits on the current branch. This command is intended for advanced Git users who want to make use of the commit structure within a branch while working with Graphite.
- Added a new command `gt branch show` that runs a native `git log` over the commits on the current branch. Includes a `--patch/-p` option to view the diffs.

**New ways to use existing commands**

- Added an `--insert` option to `gt branch create` which restacks all children of the parent of the new branch onto the new branch itself.
- Added interactive branch selection for `gt upstack onto` (similar to `gt branch checkout`). No longer requires a positional argument.

- `gt repo sync` now handles `--no-interactive` correctly.
- `gt commit amend --no-edit` now fails and warns the user when there are no staged changes, just like `gt commmit create`.
- `--no-edit` is now aliased to `-n` for `gt continue` and `gt commit amend`.
- `gt continue` now supports `--all/-a` to stage all changes.
- `submit --no-interactive` no longer un-publishes submitted PRs (unless `--draft` is specified).
- `gt downstack edit` now supports an `exec/x` option to execute arbitrary shell commands in between branch restacks (based on `git rebase --interactive`).
- `gt branch delete` now supports deleting the current branch. It checks out the parent (or trunk if Graphite cannot find a parent).

**Fixes**

- Fixed a bug where `submit --no-interactive` could prompt the user for reviewers.
- Fixed a bug where `gt repo owner` would set the remote as well, breaking `sync` and resulting in having to manually edit the configuration file to get Graphite working again.
- Fixed a bug where `submit` would fail for certain classes of branch name.
- Fixed a bug where comments in the `gt downstack edit` file were not respected.
- Fixed a bug where `p` as an alias for `pick` in `gt downstack edit` did not work properly.
- Fixed a bug where `fix` could swallow a rebase exception and leave the repository in a bad state.
- Fixed a bug where `gt branch checkout` interactive selection would fail if executed from an untracked branch.
- Fixed a bug where `gt branch delete` could fail to delete the branch but leave it in a corrupt state.

**Improvements**

- Improved the speed of `gt downstack edit` and `gt upstack onto` by being smarter about when a rebase is actually necessary.
- Improved the speed of stack validation for some commands.
- Cleaned up output of various commands and added more `--debug` logging.

**Under the hood**

- Added infra to backfill the SHA of branch parent in metadata globally wherever it is safe to do so to prepare for an upcoming update to the stack validation algorithm that we expect to improve performance and reduce hangs.
- Added plenty of tests and refactored code core to many commands for stability and future extensibility.

## 0.17.11 2022-04-23

- Allowlisted many git commands for passthrough.
- Added autocomplete support for `gt branch delete`.
- Changed force option on `gt branch delete` from `-D` to `-f`.
- Cleaned up output on `gt branch delete` failure.
